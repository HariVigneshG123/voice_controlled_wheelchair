# voice_controlled_wheelchair
The project mainly focuses on the design and implementation of a voice
controlled wheel chair for the paralysed citizens to help in their locomotion by giving
out voice commands. This project mainly concerns about the comfort of the paralysed
people who can

t bring their hands and legs into action.
There are many alternative ways for the automatic operation of the wheel
chair. One such way is controlling the wheel chair using a remote. But the main
hindrance which we face in this is that, the user has to put some muscular effort in
operating the remote. But in case of a voice controlled system there is no muscular
effort needed.
We have also used ultrasonic sensors both at the front end and the rear end of
the wheel chair so that when the wheel chair is in motion, it should immediately stop
at the detection of an obstacle. Suppose when the user issues a command at the
simultaneous detection of an obstacle, the wheel chair should not move.
This project speaks volumes about the importance and the need of a voice
controlled automated wheel chair for the paralysed people to move around places in a
safe and a secured fashion just by giving out voice commands.
